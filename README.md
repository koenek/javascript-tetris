The first version of this project was based on Ania Kubow's youtube video. Which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1JJfK09ujQ&feature=youtu.be">here</a>. Thanks to her for providing the this very well constructed tutorial!

The game you learn to make thorugh the youtube video has quite a few bugs and possibilities to improve. Using my own knowledge I aim to fix these bugs and to implement other improvements.

# Bugs fixed:
<ul>
  <li>Horizontal overflow on rotation</li>
  <li>Vertical overflow on rotation</li>
  <li>Tetrominoes continue to fall even though the game is over</li>
</ul>
